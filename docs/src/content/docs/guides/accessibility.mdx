# Accessibility

<Aside type="caution">
  Full accessibility documentation is coming soon.
</Aside>

All Loyalteez components are built with accessibility in mind, targeting WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

## General Principles

### Semantic HTML

All components use semantic HTML elements where appropriate:
- Buttons for interactive elements
- Lists for collections
- Headings for structure

### ARIA Attributes

Components include proper ARIA attributes:
- `aria-label` for meaningful descriptions
- `role` attributes where semantic elements aren't sufficient
- Live regions for dynamic content

### Keyboard Navigation

All interactive elements are:
- Focusable via Tab key
- Activatable via Enter/Space
- Navigable via arrow keys (where appropriate)

### Screen Reader Support

Components are tested with:
- VoiceOver (macOS)
- NVDA (Windows)
- JAWS (Windows)

## Component-Specific Features

### BalanceDisplay

- Uses `aria-label` with full numeric value
- Loading state has `role="status"`
- Uses `tabular-nums` for consistent digit width

### RewardToast

- Uses ARIA live region for announcements
- Dismissable via Escape key
- Focus management when appearing

## Color Contrast

All color combinations meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios:
- Normal text: 4.5:1 minimum
- Large text: 3:1 minimum
- Interactive elements: 3:1 minimum

## Testing

We recommend testing your implementation with:
- axe DevTools browser extension
- Screen readers
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Color contrast analyzers
